# Development Phase Planning

## Overview

This document outlines the phased approach to implementing the multimodal education system, including milestones, deliverables, and risk mitigation strategies for each phase.

## Development Methodology

### Agile-DevOps Hybrid Approach
- **Sprint Duration**: 2-week sprints
- **Release Cadence**: Bi-weekly releases to staging, monthly to production
- **Team Structure**: Cross-functional teams with embedded DevOps
- **Quality Gates**: Automated testing, code review, security scanning at each phase

### Architecture Decision Process
1. **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** for all major decisions
2. **Proof of Concepts (PoCs)** for high-risk technical choices
3. **Architecture Review Board** for cross-cutting concerns
4. **Technology Spike** allocation: 20% of sprint capacity
