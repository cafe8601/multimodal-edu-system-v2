# Service Mesh Architecture

Comprehensive service mesh design for inter-service communication, security, and observability in the parallel AI system.

## Directory Structure

- `mesh-design.md` - Core service mesh architecture and patterns
- `communication-patterns.md` - Inter-service communication strategies
- `service-discovery.md` - Service registration and discovery mechanisms
- `traffic-management.md` - Advanced traffic control and routing
- `security-policies.md` - mTLS configuration and security policies
- `observability.md` - Monitoring, tracing, and logging
- `istio/` - Istio-specific configurations
- `linkerd/` - Linkerd-specific configurations

## Key Features

- **Zero-Trust Security**: Automatic mTLS encryption for all service communication
- **Traffic Management**: Advanced routing, load balancing, and circuit breaking
- **Observability**: Comprehensive metrics, tracing, and access logs
- **Policy Enforcement**: Network policies and access control
- **Resilience**: Retry policies, timeouts, and fault injection

## Service Mesh Options

### Istio (Recommended)
- **Pros**: Feature-rich, strong ecosystem, extensive configuration options
- **Cons**: Higher resource usage, complexity
- **Best for**: Large-scale deployments with complex requirements

### Linkerd
- **Pros**: Lightweight, excellent observability, easier to operate
- **Cons**: Fewer features, smaller ecosystem
- **Best for**: Performance-critical applications, simpler deployments

### Consul Connect
- **Pros**: Multi-platform support, HashiCorp ecosystem integration
- **Cons**: Less Kubernetes-native, requires Consul infrastructure
- **Best for**: Multi-cloud or hybrid environments

## Quick Start

1. Review [Mesh Design](mesh-design.md) for architecture overview
2. Choose your service mesh implementation (Istio recommended)
3. Configure [Service Discovery](service-discovery.md)
4. Implement [Security Policies](security-policies.md)
5. Set up [Observability](observability.md)

## Integration Points

- **API Gateway**: Seamless integration with gateway routing
- **Kubernetes**: Native Kubernetes resource management
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger integration
- **CI/CD**: Automated deployment and configuration management
