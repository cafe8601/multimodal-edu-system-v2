# API Gateway Architecture

This directory contains the comprehensive API Gateway architecture documentation for the parallel AI system, designed for high scalability, security, and performance.

## Directory Structure

- `gateway-design.md` - Core API Gateway architecture and patterns
- `routing-patterns.md` - Advanced routing and load balancing strategies
- `authentication-flow.md` - Authentication and authorization architecture
- `rate-limiting.md` - Rate limiting and circuit breaker patterns
- `versioning-strategy.md` - API versioning and backward compatibility
- `adr/` - Architectural Decision Records
- `diagrams/` - System architecture diagrams

## Key Features

- **High-Performance Routing**: Advanced load balancing with health checks
- **Security-First**: Multi-layer authentication with OAuth 2.0/OIDC
- **Resilience**: Circuit breakers, retries, and graceful degradation
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling with auto-discovery
- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and tracing

## Quick Start

1. Review the [Gateway Design](gateway-design.md) for overall architecture
2. Check [ADRs](adr/) for key architectural decisions
3. Implement routing patterns from [Routing Patterns](routing-patterns.md)
4. Configure security following [Authentication Flow](authentication-flow.md)

## Integration Points

- **Service Mesh**: Integrates with Istio/Linkerd for advanced traffic management
- **Message Queues**: Event-driven patterns with RabbitMQ/Apache Kafka
- **Databases**: Multi-database support with connection pooling
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, and distributed tracing

See [../service-mesh/](../service-mesh/) for service mesh integration details.
