# ADR-001: API Gateway Technology Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The parallel AI system requires a robust API Gateway solution that can handle high traffic volumes, provide advanced routing capabilities, and integrate seamlessly with our microservices architecture. We need to select between several mature API Gateway technologies.

## Decision
We will use **Kong Gateway** as our primary API Gateway solution, with **Envoy Proxy** as the service mesh data plane.

## Rationale

### Kong Gateway Advantages:
1. **Performance**: Handles 10,000+ RPS with low latency
2. **Plugin Ecosystem**: Rich plugin architecture for extensibility
3. **Kubernetes Integration**: Native Kubernetes CRDs and operators
4. **Community Support**: Large community and commercial backing
5. **Flexibility**: Both open-source and enterprise options

### Alternative Considerations:

**AWS API Gateway**:
- ❌ Vendor lock-in concerns
- ❌ Limited customization options
- ✅ Fully managed service
- ❌ Higher latency for compute-intensive workloads

**Istio Gateway**:
- ✅ Excellent service mesh integration
- ❌ Complex configuration
- ❌ Higher resource overhead
- ✅ Advanced traffic management

**Ambassador/Emissary**:
- ✅ Kubernetes-native
- ❌ Smaller ecosystem
- ✅ Good developer experience
- ❌ Less mature enterprise features

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Gateway (Weeks 1-2)
- Deploy Kong using Kubernetes Operator
- Configure basic routing and load balancing
- Implement health checks and monitoring

### Phase 2: Security (Weeks 3-4)
- Configure OAuth 2.0/OIDC authentication
- Implement rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Set up TLS termination with cert-manager

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 5-6)
- Implement custom plugins for AI-specific routing
- Configure circuit breakers and retries
- Set up comprehensive observability

### Phase 4: Service Mesh Integration (Weeks 7-8)
- Deploy Envoy as sidecar proxies
- Configure mTLS between services
- Implement advanced traffic policies

## Configuration

```yaml
# Kong Deployment Configuration
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: kong

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: kong-gateway
  namespace: kong
spec:
  replicas: 3
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: kong
        image: kong:3.5-alpine
        env:
        - name: KONG_DATABASE
          value: postgres
        - name: KONG_PG_HOST
          value: postgres-service
        - name: KONG_PROXY_ACCESS_LOG
          value: /dev/stdout
        - name: KONG_ADMIN_ACCESS_LOG
          value: /dev/stdout
        - name: KONG_PROXY_ERROR_LOG
          value: /dev/stderr
        - name: KONG_ADMIN_ERROR_LOG
          value: /dev/stderr
        - name: KONG_ADMIN_LISTEN
          value: 0.0.0.0:8001
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 1000m
            memory: 2Gi
          limits:
            cpu: 2000m
            memory: 4Gi
```

## Performance Requirements

- **Throughput**: 10,000+ RPS per instance
- **Latency**: P95 < 50ms (excluding backend processing)
- **Availability**: 99.95% uptime
- **Scalability**: Auto-scale from 3 to 50 instances

## Monitoring and Observability

```yaml
monitoring:
  metrics:
    - kong_http_requests_total
    - kong_latency_bucket
    - kong_bandwidth_bytes
    - kong_nginx_connections
  
  logging:
    format: json
    level: info
    destinations:
      - stdout
      - elasticsearch
  
  tracing:
    provider: jaeger
    sampling_rate: 0.1
    headers:
      - x-request-id
      - x-correlation-id
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**:
   - JWT validation with RS256 signatures
   - OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow
   - API key management with rotation

2. **Authorization**:
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Scope-based permissions
   - Dynamic policy evaluation

3. **Network Security**:
   - TLS 1.3 minimum
   - Certificate pinning
   - Rate limiting by IP and user

## Consequences

### Positive:
- High performance and scalability
- Rich plugin ecosystem for customization
- Strong Kubernetes integration
- Active community and support
- Flexibility for future requirements

### Negative:
- Additional operational complexity
- Learning curve for team
- Database dependency (PostgreSQL)
- Plugin development overhead for custom features

### Risks and Mitigations:

1. **Single Point of Failure**:
   - **Risk**: Gateway becomes bottleneck
   - **Mitigation**: Multi-instance deployment with load balancing

2. **Database Dependency**:
   - **Risk**: Database outage affects gateway
   - **Mitigation**: Highly available PostgreSQL with read replicas

3. **Performance Degradation**:
   - **Risk**: Plugin overhead impacts performance
   - **Mitigation**: Careful plugin selection and performance testing

## Review and Update

This decision will be reviewed quarterly and updated based on:
- Performance metrics and scaling requirements
- New feature requirements from the AI system
- Technology ecosystem changes
- Operational experience and feedback
