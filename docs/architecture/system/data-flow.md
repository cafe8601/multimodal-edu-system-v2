# Data Flow Diagrams and Service Interactions

## Overview

This document details the data flow patterns and service interactions within the multimodal education system, focusing on how information moves through the system and how services collaborate to deliver functionality.

## Core Data Flow Patterns

### 1. Multimodal Content Processing Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Input] --> B{Input Type}
    B -->|Text| C[Text Processing Service]
    B -->|Image| D[Image Processing Service]
    B -->|Voice| E[Speech Processing Service]
    B -->|Document| F[Document Processing Service]
    
    C --> G[Content Enrichment Service]
    D --> G
    E --> G
    F --> G
    
    G --> H[Agent Orchestration Service]
    H --> I[Learning Management Service]
    I --> J[Response Generation]
    J --> K[User Interface]
    
    G --> L[Content Storage]
    H --> M[Agent State Storage]
    I --> N[Learning Analytics DB]
```

### 2. User Authentication and Authorization Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant AG as API Gateway
    participant AS as Auth Service
    participant US as User Service
    participant TS as Target Service
    
    U->>AG: Request with credentials
    AG->>AS: Authenticate user
    AS->>US: Validate user data
    US-->>AS: User profile
    AS-->>AG: JWT token
    AG->>TS: Forward request with token
    TS->>AS: Validate token
    AS-->>TS: Token valid + permissions
    TS-->>AG: Response
    AG-->>U: Response with session
```

### 3. Agent Orchestration and Task Management Flow

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Request Processing"
        A[Incoming Request] --> B[Request Parser]
        B --> C[Task Decomposition]
        C --> D[Agent Selection]
    end
    
    subgraph "Agent Coordination"
        D --> E[Task Queue]
        E --> F[Agent Coordinator]
        F --> G[Parallel Agent Execution]
        G --> H[Result Aggregation]
    end
    
    subgraph "Response Generation"
        H --> I[Response Synthesis]
        I --> J[Quality Validation]
        J --> K[Response Delivery]
    end
    
    subgraph "Learning Loop"
        K --> L[Feedback Collection]
        L --> M[Model Updates]
        M --> N[Agent Improvement]
        N --> D
    end
```

## Service Interaction Patterns

### 1. Synchronous Service Communication

#### REST API Communication Pattern
```yaml
Pattern: Request-Response
Use Cases:
  - User profile retrieval
  - Content metadata queries
  - Real-time validation
  
Communication Flow:
  Client → API Gateway → Service → Database → Response
  
Characteristics:
  - Immediate response required
  - Simple request-response cycle
  - HTTP status codes for error handling
```

#### GraphQL Communication Pattern
```yaml
Pattern: Flexible Query
Use Cases:
  - Complex data retrieval
  - Mobile app data loading
  - Dashboard aggregations
  
Communication Flow:
  Client → GraphQL Gateway → Multiple Services → Aggregated Response
  
Characteristics:
  - Single endpoint
  - Optimized data fetching
  - Type-safe schema
```

### 2. Asynchronous Service Communication

#### Event-Driven Communication
```yaml
Pattern: Publish-Subscribe
Use Cases:
  - Content processing completion
  - User action tracking
  - System state changes
  
Communication Flow:
  Service A → Event Bus → Multiple Subscribers
  
Characteristics:
  - Loose coupling
  - Scalable processing
  - Eventually consistent
```

#### Message Queue Communication
```yaml
Pattern: Task Distribution
Use Cases:
  - Agent task assignment
  - Batch processing jobs
  - Background operations
  
Communication Flow:
  Producer → Message Queue → Consumer Workers
  
Characteristics:
  - Load balancing
  - Fault tolerance
  - Processing guarantees
```

## Detailed Service Interactions

### Content Processing Workflow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UI as User Interface
    participant AG as API Gateway
    participant CP as Content Processor
    participant AO as Agent Orchestrator
    participant AS as Agent Service
    participant DB as Database
    participant ES as Event Service
    
    UI->>AG: Upload multimodal content
    AG->>CP: Process content request
    CP->>DB: Store raw content
    CP->>ES: Publish content.uploaded event
    
    ES->>AO: Notify content ready
    AO->>AS: Assign processing agents
    AS-->>AO: Agents assigned
    AO->>AS: Start parallel processing
    
    par Agent Processing
        AS->>AS: Text analysis
    and
        AS->>AS: Image recognition
    and
        AS->>AS: Audio transcription
    end
    
    AS-->>AO: Processing results
    AO->>DB: Store enriched content
    AO->>ES: Publish content.processed event
    ES->>UI: Notify processing complete
```

### Learning Session Flow

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Session Initiation"
        A[User Request] --> B[Session Service]
        B --> C[User Profile Lookup]
        C --> D[Learning Path Service]
    end
    
    subgraph "Content Delivery"
        D --> E[Content Recommendation]
        E --> F[Multimodal Content Service]
        F --> G[Adaptive Rendering]
    end
    
    subgraph "Interaction Processing"
        G --> H[User Interaction Capture]
        H --> I[Real-time Analysis]
        I --> J[Adaptive Response]
    end
    
    subgraph "Learning Analytics"
        J --> K[Progress Tracking]
        K --> L[Performance Analytics]
        L --> M[Recommendation Updates]
        M --> D
    end
```

## Data Consistency Patterns

### 1. Strong Consistency (ACID Transactions)
```yaml
Use Cases:
  - Financial transactions
  - User account operations
  - Critical system state changes

Implementation:
  - PostgreSQL transactions
  - Two-phase commit for distributed transactions
  - Saga pattern for long-running processes
```

### 2. Eventually Consistency (BASE)
```yaml
Use Cases:
  - Content analytics
  - Search index updates
  - Recommendation system updates

Implementation:
  - Event sourcing
  - CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
  - Eventual consistency with compensation
```

### 3. Session Consistency
```yaml
Use Cases:
  - User session data
  - Shopping cart state
  - Temporary calculations

Implementation:
  - Redis-based session storage
  - Sticky sessions with load balancer
  - Session replication across nodes
```

## Error Handling and Recovery Patterns

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Closed
    Closed --> Open: Failure threshold reached
    Open --> HalfOpen: Timeout expires
    HalfOpen --> Closed: Success
    HalfOpen --> Open: Failure
    
    Closed: Normal operation
    Open: Block requests, return error
    HalfOpen: Test with limited requests
```

### Retry and Timeout Strategies
```yaml
Exponential Backoff:
  - Initial delay: 100ms
  - Max delay: 30s
  - Max retries: 5
  - Jitter: ±20%

Timeout Configuration:
  - API calls: 5s
  - Database queries: 10s
  - AI service calls: 30s
  - File uploads: 300s

Dead Letter Queue:
  - Failed message storage
  - Manual intervention required
  - Retry after fix
```

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### Caching Layers
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Client Request] --> B[CDN Cache]
    B -->|Cache Miss| C[API Gateway Cache]
    C -->|Cache Miss| D[Application Cache]
    D -->|Cache Miss| E[Database Cache]
    E -->|Cache Miss| F[Database]
    
    B -->|Cache Hit| G[Response]
    C -->|Cache Hit| G
    D -->|Cache Hit| G
    E -->|Cache Hit| G
    F --> G
```

### Data Partitioning Strategy
```yaml
Horizontal Partitioning (Sharding):
  - User data by user_id hash
  - Content data by content_type
  - Analytics data by timestamp

Vertical Partitioning:
  - Separate read/write databases
  - Archive old data to cold storage
  - Optimize tables for specific queries

Geographic Partitioning:
  - Data locality by region
  - Compliance with data residency
  - Reduced latency
```

## Monitoring and Observability Data Flows

### Metrics Collection Pipeline
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Application Metrics] --> B[Prometheus Agent]
    C[Infrastructure Metrics] --> B
    D[Custom Metrics] --> B
    
    B --> E[Prometheus Server]
    E --> F[Grafana Dashboard]
    E --> G[AlertManager]
    
    G --> H[PagerDuty/Slack]
    F --> I[Operations Team]
```

### Distributed Tracing Flow

    A->>B: Call with trace context
    B->>C: Call with trace context
    C-->>B: Response with span
    B-->>A: Response with span
    
    A->>J: Send trace data
    B->>J: Send trace data
    C->>J: Send trace data
    
    J->>J: Correlate spans
```
